# UV / IR cut filter spectral data

This folder measured spectral response data several color filters. They were 
[measured by sebastian](https://www.apertus.org/axiom-team-talk-15-4-optical-filters-firmware-2-article-june-2020) 
who provided [a PDF](raw/spectrometer%20results.pdf).
The data was then extracted with an [online tool](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/) from the plot on page 4 
and then cleaned and converted to transmissivity data with a [python script](raw/convert.py).
