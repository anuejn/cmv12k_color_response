# CMV1200 Spectral data

this folder contains spectral response data for the AMS CMV1200.
It was extracted from the plots on page 19 of the [datasheet](raw/CMV12000_DS000603_5-00.pdf) using a mixture of inkscape,
[this plugin](https://github.com/camrbuss/nodes_to_csv) and then rescaling the data with a [python script](raw/convert.py) to match the real units.
